## Introduction
**Semantic Search** is a tool designed for efficient retrieval of semantically related content within a dataset. Traditional keyword search engines lack the ability to understand the meaning behind words, but this engine applies natural language processing to provide more accurate results by interpreting context and relevance.

## Features
- **Semantic Embeddings**: Uses NLP embeddings for semantic representation of text.
- **Similarity Scoring**: Calculates similarity scores to retrieve the most relevant results.
- **ISM Versioning**: Applies search queries to previous versions of the ISM.
